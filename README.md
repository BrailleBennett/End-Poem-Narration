# End Poem Narration

## What is this?

This mod is made to add human voicing to the poem seen after going through the exit portal in the end for the first
time.
It was originally remastered for inclusion into
the [Minecraft Access](https://github.com/Minecraft-Access/Minecraft-Access) mod,
but due to the size of the sound file, and the opportunity for non-visually impaired players to use the mod, it was
split off into a companion mod which doesn't require Minecraft Access.
